## Work Overview
Assisted in developing a commercially viable lead-free brass alloy that could revolutionize the brass industry. 

Won First Place Prize at the 2025 Student Poster Contest in the Structural Materials Division at the Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS) conference in Las Vegas!
 
 **See Poster Below**

Conducted competitor analysis research using the USPTO website to generate ideas for viable alloys. 

Utilized Thermocalc for computational work, where, using all relevant data that has been published, predicted what compositions will occur from casting an alloy without having to actually cast that alloy.

Performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) scans along with the hardness and ductility testing that allowed the team to analyze different alloys to measure their viability as a lead-free brass alloy. 
 
Prepared elements down to a thousandth-gram precision, then used a furnace to smelt them into a rod, which I then performed metallurgical tests on.
