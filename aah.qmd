## Impact Overview
I was recruited by Prof. Bassman at HMC to join her research team in Australia during the Summer to develop commercially viable lead-free brass alloys. The reason behind the focus on brass alloys was to provide a solution for the severe health impacts of lead contamination in drinking water that comes from brass pipes. I was one of three members of the experimental team that focused on alloy development and testing. I wore many hats on the team, but my two main ones were doing analysis on our alloys using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and doing alloy simulation using Thermo-Calc. The SEM allowed me to zoom so far in that I could see the microstructures of our alloys. From these SEM images, I conducted an analysis, which was the main source of information that steered the direction of further development. I used the Thermo-Calc software to predict what phases would occur in the microstructures for different alloy compositions without having to smelt the alloys, speeding up the testing cycle time. My contributions also spanned from competitor patent research to alloy smelting, to writing a research poster along with one other member of the team. The research poster we wrote resulted in us winning an international research award granted by the Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS).
