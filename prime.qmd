Researched and prototyped novel navigation techniques to be implemented on the Mk-30 delivery drones for the Amazon Prime Air team through clinic.

Integrated and tuned sensor fusion between RFID and LiDAR for robust state estimation. 

Developed ROS nodes for real-time interfacing between perception systems and flight control.

:::

Resolved EMI-related takeoff localization failures with computer vision by designing a vision-based AprilTag system for accurate pose estimation using onboard cameras. 

Researched different navigation techniques that didn't rely on GPS and wrote sections in a research paper on LiDAR and vision-based localization techniques for aerial robotics.
