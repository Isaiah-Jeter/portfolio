I designed and implemented a custom multicycle processor module in SystemVerilog capable of performing fused multiply-add operations on 16-bit half-precision floating-point numbers. I designed the unit in SystemVerilog, synthesized my iterations using Verilator. For testing, I wrote unit tests and analyzed register and variable signals over time.  I also evaluated the hardware performance of FMA by generating area and timing reports, identifying the critical path, and computing the area–delay product to balance speed and efficiency.

This project challenged me to integrate multiple hardware concepts, including exponent alignment, mantissa normalization, and handling corner cases for addition and subtraction with differing exponents. I built supporting modules such as unpacking, product rounding, and shift/leading-zero detection logic, which all come together to execute floating-point arithmetic at the hardware level. By working through the details of rounding, overflow, and subtraction edge cases, I strengthened both my understanding of floating-point standards and my ability to architect complex digital designs.
