## Impact Overview
During my last week at AHI I was asked to design a remote control for the winch I had previously written the driver for. This request came from the mechanical team and led to a rushed but fruitful collaobrtion during my last days at the company. The winch was replacing a manual tether-looping process with a fully automated winch system. This evolution was critical for the company since it allowed for controlled deployment and recovery of the ROV at precise distances and speeds. The ROV's primary purposed was the inspection and repair of subsea infrastrcuture making everything surrounding it a mission critical product for the company. By developing the firmware and control logic for the winch I enabled the team to rapidly test and iterate on the ROV housing designs. In order to determine the features on the controller I worked closely with the mechanical team and testing team to align hardware features with their deliverables.

## What I owned {.unnumbered}

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

::: {.card .p-3}
**High-Frequency Stepper Driver**
Developed a custom driver using the STM32 HSE clock to generate high-precision signals, mimicking PWM for smooth stepper motor actuation.
:::

::: {.card .p-3}
**Precision Motor Control**
Implemented closed-loop control algorithms to manage winch speed and torque during payload deployment.
:::

::: {.card .p-3}
**Safety State Machines**
Designed firmware logic to detect stall conditions or current spikes, preventing hardware damage during retraction.
:::

::: {.card .p-3}
**Feature design**
Worked with mechanical team to design the features of the remote based on product deliverables and test items.
:::

::: {.card .p-3}
**Hardware Integration & Housing**
Designed and executed the electrical wiring architecture and informed development of the protective housing unit for the electronics.

::: {.card .p-3}
**Dynamic Velocity Scaling**
Built "Faster" and "Slower" functions that live-updated the stepper pulse frequency for variable-speed recovery and deployment.
:::

::: {.card .p-3}
**Manual Jogging**
Developed a "Jog" mode for fine-tuned positioning, allowing operators to hold and release the jog button to make incremental adjustments to the ROV’s depth.
:::

::: {.card .p-3}
**Directional Switching**
Programmed the logic to toggle motor polarity, enabling seamless transitions between deployment and recollection of the ROV.
:::

::: {.card .p-3}
**Start/Stop**
Implemented interrupt-driven logic to safely initialize or halt winch operations for a controlled ROV deployment.
