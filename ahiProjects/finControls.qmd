## Impact Overview


During primary testing of the AUV, the driver noted that the control algorithm in place was making it hard to generate lift with the fins (shown in video at the bottom of the page). The initial solution for this was alternating all of the fins by 45 degrees so that generating lift would be easier. After implementing this change, the team noticed that the old control system no longer worked for the new fin configurations. I took ownership of developing a new control system for the alternate fin configuration. This involved calculating inertia matrices, reading Fossen’s Marine Craft Hydrodynamics and Motor Control textbook, and writing new airframe files in the firmware. My control system’s accuracy was verified via an in-office test stand (shown below) and during the second in-water test of the AUV.

::: {.card .p-3}
**Custom Airframe Firmware**
Made custom airframe file in the firmware that factored in the different torque, pitch, and roll allocation of each fin in the new fin configuration.
