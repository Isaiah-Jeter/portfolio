## Impact Overview
I built a full PX4/ROS 2/Gazebo simulation environment for the company’s autonomous underwater vehicle, enabling automated test scenarios without the hardware needing to touch the water. By shifting trial-and-error into simulation, I accelerated the development cycle and reduced physical testing, which costs both money and time. My simulation's accuracy was verified thorugh real worl testing which mirrored simulation results.
