I built, simulated, and debugged a multicycle RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog. This was my first endeavor into RISC-V, and following this went to help the RISC-V research team from my school. While building this multicycle processor, I learned about pipelined processors, processor data paths, and processor memory.
