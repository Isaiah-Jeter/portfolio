    "text": "This semester I’m taking MircoP’s to strengthen my foundation in embedded systems. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how hardware and software interact at the lowest levels. I want to build the skills to better be able to design, program, and debug microcontroller-based systems, since these are commonly using in robotics and autonomous platforms. I see this course as a chance to prepare myself for future projects in robotics."

    "text": "Lab 1 AI Prototype Review\nTo synthesise hardware for Lab 1, I used Claudeai basic plan with the following prompt: “Write SystemVerilog HDL to leverage the internal high-speed oscillator in the Lattice UP5K FPGA and blink an LED at 2 Hz. Take full advantage of SystemVerilog syntax, for example, using logic instead of wire and reg.” The SystemVerilog constructs that the LLm generated that were new to me were localparam and a different instantiation method for the high-speed oscillator. The localparam, I guess, makes sense, but it is different from what I used. I just hardcoded the number, so in hardware it would take up a register. I don’t exactly know what local param does, but I’d assume it’d do the same thing as I did, which is take up a register. The different instation method being new to me, I feel like it may just be a lack of experience on y part because the instation method I used, which was copy pasted from one of the tutorials as per instructions in the lab, was also new to me.\nThe LLM-generated code did not end up synthesizing the first time around or even after I provided it with the errors on the second and third time around. The main issue was that it was using an unrecognized name for the high-speed oscillator. Even after telling it this, it chose another unrecognized name for it. The exact error Radiant outputted was “instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC. VERI-1063.” Next time I incorporate an LLm into my workflow, I would give it more details on my hardware to avoid such troubles."
