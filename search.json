    "text": "This semester I’m taking MircoP’s to strengthen my foundation in embedded systems. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how hardware and software interact at the lowest levels. I want to build the skills to better be able to design, program, and debug microcontroller-based systems, since these are commonly using in robotics and autonomous platforms. I see this course as a chance to prepare myself for future projects in robotics."
