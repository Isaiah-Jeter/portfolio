    "text": "Impact Overview\nDuring my last week at AHI I was asked to design a remote control for the winch I had previously written the driver for. This request came from the mechanical team and led to a rushed but fruitful collaobrtion during my last days at the company. The winch was replacing a manual tether-looping process with a fully automated winch system. This evolution was critical for the company since it allowed for controlled deployment and recovery of the ROV at precise distances and speeds. The ROV’s primary purposed was the inspection and repair of subsea infrastrcuture making everything surrounding it a mission critical product for the company. By developing the firmware and control logic for the winch I enabled the team to rapidly test and iterate on the ROV housing designs. In order to determine the features on the controller I worked closely with the mechanical team and testing team to align hardware features with their deliverables."

This decision was based on both my experience with programming and cameras, as well as my familiarity with using AprilTags (shown above) for pose estimation. The idea I pitched for the AprilTags is that when a camera is trained on them, depending on the size and orientation of the markers on the tag, it’s possible to calculate the drone’s position relative to the tag. Since the AprilTags location would be static and known, calculating where the drone was in space would be trivial. Founded on that idea, my subteam designed a vision-based AprilTag pose estimation system using onboard cameras, enabling reliable initialization in challenging electromagnetic environments."

My work wasn’t just developing my skills, but directly shaping the future of the company’s technology. Following the completion of my first two projects, I began to be entrusted with mission-critical responsibilities ranging from developing firmware and drivers for STM32 microcontrollers, to building real-time TCP-based control systems in FreeRTOS, to implementing Wi-Fi video streaming pipelines. I made each prompt from my manager develop into a prototype, then into a production-ready technology, at the laser-fast times required at a startup. My reliability when it came to getting the job done fast established to my team both my technical ability and my capacity to adapt at startup speed."

The initial solution for this was alternating all of the fins by 45 degrees so that generating lift would be easier. After implementing this change, the team noticed that the old control system no longer worked for the new fin configurations. I took ownership of developing a new control system for the alternate fin configuration. This involved calculating inertia matrices, reading Fossen’s Marine Craft Hydrodynamics and Motor Control textbook, and writing new airframe files in the firmware. My control system’s accuracy was verified via an in-office test stand (shown below) and during the second in-water test of the AUV.\n\n\n\nPicture of mini test stand used for fin configuration testing and servo testing"

    "text": "Impact Overview\nDuring my last week at AHI I was asked to design a remote control for the winch I had previously written the driver for. This request came from the mechanical team and led to a rushed but fruitful collaobrtion during my last days at the company. The winch was replacing a manual tether-looping process with a fully automated winch system. This evolution was critical for the company since it allowed for controlled deployment and recovery of the ROV at precise distances and speeds. The ROV’s primary purposed was the inspection and repair of subsea infrastrcuture making everything surrounding it a mission critical product for the company. By developing the firmware and control logic for the winch I enabled the team to rapidly test and iterate on the ROV housing designs. In order to determine the features on the controller I worked closely with the mechanical team and testing team to align hardware features with their deliverables."

This decision was based on both my experience with programming and cameras, as well as my familiarity with using AprilTags (shown above) for pose estimation. The idea I pitched for the AprilTags is that when a camera is trained on them, depending on the size and orientation of the markers on the tag, it’s possible to calculate the drone’s position relative to the tag. Since the AprilTags location would be static and known, calculating where the drone was in space would be trivial. Founded on that idea, my subteam designed a vision-based AprilTag pose estimation system using onboard cameras, enabling reliable initialization in challenging electromagnetic environments."
